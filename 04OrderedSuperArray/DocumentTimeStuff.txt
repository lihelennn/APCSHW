1. I tried to test my insertionSort (), but it is not working. I tried simple methods such as test1.insertionSort() after adding elements such as “hello,” “bbb,” “zzz,” “woof,” and so on. However, this insertionSort() keeps on giving me an IndexOutofBounds Error. 
Alright, so it finally works now, but the code is super long, and I feel like I did what is going on the the bad Insertion sort, but a lot more complex…great.

2. I will test my insertionSort() by make an array of Strings with while loops. There will be approximately 100 words, and each word will be a modification of the original String, “aaa.” The first letter will be changed to a random letter throughout my adding of Strings to my array. This uses Character.toString(char).
…and this method for random string worked!
